# CORS Fix Deployment Guide

## Issue Fixed
Fixed CORS error: "The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header has a value 'https://cultural-ai-chi.vercel.app/' that is not equal to the supplied origin."

## Changes Made
Updated CORS configuration in all backend files to:
1. Handle both URLs with and without trailing slashes
2. Explicitly allow your Vercel frontend URL
3. Maintain flexibility for environment variables

## Files Modified
- `Cultural-AI/backend/finalserver.js`
- `Cultural-AI/backend/main.js` 
- `Cultural-AI/backend/server.js`

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit Changes
```bash
cd Cultural-AI
git add .
git commit -m "Fix CORS configuration for Vercel frontend"
git push
```

### 2. Deploy to Render.com
Since your backend is hosted on Render.com, you have two options:

#### Option A: Auto-Deploy (if connected to GitHub)
- Render will automatically detect the changes and redeploy
- Wait for deployment to complete (check Render dashboard)

#### Option B: Manual Deploy
- Go to your Render dashboard
- Find your backend service
- Click "Manual Deploy" â†’ "Deploy latest commit"

### 3. Environment Variables (Optional)
In your Render.com environment variables, ensure:
- `FRONTEND_URL` is set to `https://cultural-ai-chi.vercel.app` (without trailing slash)

### 4. Test the Fix
- Wait for deployment to complete
- Try the climate impact feature again
- The CORS error should be resolved

## What the Fix Does
The new CORS configuration:
- Accepts requests from multiple allowed origins
- Normalizes URLs by removing trailing slashes
- Compares origins properly
- Maintains security while fixing the compatibility issue

## Backup Plan
If issues persist, you can also add this to your Render.com environment variables:
```
FRONTEND_URL=https://cultural-ai-chi.vercel.app
```

Make sure there's no trailing slash in the environment variable.
